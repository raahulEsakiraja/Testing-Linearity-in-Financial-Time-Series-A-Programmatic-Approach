# Testing-Linearity-in-Financial-Time-Series-A-Programmatic-Approach
This project uses Python to test nonlinearity in financial time series. We apply the BDS test and train neural networks on residuals from linear models. By analyzing USD/GBP, BTC, and TSLA data, we detect hidden patterns that standard models may missâ€”showing where code can uncover nonlinear structure.
