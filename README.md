# Testing-Linearity-in-Financial-Time-Series-A-Programmatic-Approach
This project uses Python to test nonlinearity in financial time series. By analyzing USD/GBP, BTC, and TSLA data, we detect hidden patterns that standard models may missâ€”showing where code can uncover nonlinear structure using a programmatic approuch and machine linear.

This project explores the presence of nonlinearity in financial time series using two statistical tools: the BDS Test and White's Neural Network (WNN) Test. The goal is to assess whether relationships in daily, weekly, and monthly data for USD/GBP, BTC, and TSLA are linear or nonlinear. Hypothesis testing is used as a framework, with the null hypothesis assuming a linear relationship and the alternative suggesting nonlinearity. The BDS Test checks for deviations from i.i.d. behavior, while the WNN Test evaluates whether residuals from a linear model contain structure that a neural network can exploit. If the neural network can predict residuals well, it suggests the linear model missed nonlinearity. Results show that daily and weekly data often exhibit nonlinear patterns, while monthly data tends to be more linear. This has implications for model selection and forecasting accuracy in financial contexts.
